                        <strong>Cialdini</strong> has identified 7 key influencers of persuasion (based on 35 years of evidence based
                        research): Weapons of influence (aka reason why), Reciprocation, Commitment & Consistency, Social
                        proof, Liking, Authority and Scarcity.

                            <strong>Weapons of Influence</strong>
                            <br>
                            <u>Reason Why</u> – Attaching a reason to a request increases the success rate: “I have 5 pages,
                            can I use the Xerox machine before you because I’m in a rush” had a success rate of 94% vs.60%
                            success rate when no ‘reason why’ was given.
                            <br>
                            <br> Showing potential customers the most expensive item first then working downwards in price leads
                            to an increase in the amount spent (as the next products seem cheaper in comparison).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reciprocation</strong>
                            <br>
                            <u>Social obligations</u> – Humans inherently dislike being indebted to someone, so much so that
                            often a small gift or favour will lead to a larger reciprocal response. This fact is exploited
                            worldwide, e.g. Hare Krishna’s who offer a ‘gift’ of a flower when soliciting for donations (which
                            they refuse to take back). As the receiver cannot unburden themselves from the subconscious debt,
                            the social pressure to donate leads to a higher donation rate than merely soliciting alone. An
                            Indian supermarket sold £1000 of cheese in a few hours by inviting customers to slice their own
                            free samples.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <u>Reject & Retreat</u> – This technique consists of first demanding a high price (or a large favour),
                            then waiting for it to be rejected, only to follow this demand up with a smaller one, (that you
                            really wanted all along). Quote from a child: ‘If you want a kitten, first ask for a pony’ (Ed).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Commitment and Consistency</strong>
                            <br> We tend to remain consistent to our commitments, once we have made them (consistency is a socially
                            attractive trait). Studies found that when people are asked if they would vote led to an increased
                            likelihood to follow-through. This is why it is recommended to write down/verbally state our
                            goals, as we then stand a much greater chance of sticking to them (cf
                            <a href="http://www.stickk.com" target="_blank">http://www.stickk.com</a> – Ed)
                            <br> Households were called and asked to predict what they would do if they were asked to volunteer
                            for three hours to collect for charity. Three days later, they were recalled and asked to collect
                            for charity. This led to an increase in the numbers of volunteers by 700%. Its use in business
                            was put succinctly by an article in American Salesman.
                            <em>“When a person has signed an order for your merchandise, even though the profit is small, he
                                is no longer a prospect – he is a customer”</em>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <u>Living up to our identity</u> – “We are what we repeatedly do”- Aristotle. We will act in ways
                            that are consistent with our identity, beliefs and values.
                            <br>
                            <br> American POW’s in Korea who were made into collaborators, started co-operating when they were
                            labelled and classed themselves as a collaborator.

                            <strong>Social Proof </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>People are influenced by what others do. At an unfamiliar event or situation, we look to others
                            on the correct etiquette. This is exploited for example, in bars or at church collections. The
                            tips/donations are sometimes ‘salted’ by having money already placed there or having a stooge
                            give money to stimulate others to tip. This effect is amplified by how similar the person whose
                            actions we are watching are to ourselves.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Liking </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> As a rule, we prefer to say yes to the request of those we like over those we don’t. There are
                            several key properties that determine our view of people: Attractiveness, similarity, compliments,
                            contact & co-operation, conditioning and association. Studies found we automatically attribute
                            traits such as talent, kindness, honesty and intelligence to attractive people. It is no co-incidence
                            that ‘attractive’ political candidates received two and a half times the votes of unattractive
                            rivals.
                            <br>
                            <br> We like people who are similar to us, with the same views, interests, beliefs and values. We
                            therefore need to find areas of shared interest to increase rapport and connection.
                            <br>
                            <br> Joe Girard won for twelve years straight the title of ‘Number one salesman’, selling on average
                            five cars or trucks a day. His formula behind his success was simple; he provided a fair price,
                            and someone they like to buy from. One of his key tactics however was to employ the use of compliments.
                            Every month he sent every one of his 13,000 former customers a holiday greeting card containing
                            a personal message. The holiday greeting changed from month to month (Happy New Year, Happy Easter
                            etc.), but the message printed on the face of the card never varied. It only read ‘I like you’.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <u>Endless chain</u> – When a salesman approaches the person recommended, saying “your friend recommended
                            this for you” it increases the chance they will make a purchase. Turning the salesman away is
                            difficult as it’s like rejecting one’s friend.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Authority</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> The greater the perceived authority of a person, the more likely people are to comply (cf the
                            Stanley Milgram experiments).
                            <br>
                            <br>Hospitals have a 12% daily error rate. This is because, nurses and junior doctors will very rarely
                            challenge the decision made by an authoritative figure, despite receiving potentially lethal,
                            or bizarre requests.
                            <br>
                            <br>We often perceive and interact with people with authority differently. The more power a person
                            is deemed to have, the more generous people are when estimating their height, and the more cautious
                            we are with our conversations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Scarcity</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br> We are more motivated to act if we think we are going to lose something, than if we are to gain
                            something. ‘
                            <em>Save</em> £50 a month on…’ would not be as effective as ‘You are
                            <em>losing</em> £50 a month on…’. An item that is scarce is more desirable than one that is freely
                            available.
                            <br>
                            <br>The high pressure environment, like an auction can lead an item being sold for an elevated price
                            as the buyers fear losing out to another person.
